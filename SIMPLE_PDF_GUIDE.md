# Simple PDF Integration Guide

## ✅ **What's Implemented:**

### **Your PDF Integration:**
- **PDF Location**: `lib/assets/sources/source.pdf`
- **Auto-loaded**: PDF content is extracted when app starts
- **AI Access**: Saira can reference your PDF content in responses

### **Short, Relevant Responses:**
- **2-3 sentences maximum** per response
- **Only references PDF when relevant** to user's question
- **Conversational tone**, not clinical
- **Focused on most important points**

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **App starts** → Your PDF is automatically loaded and text extracted
2. **User asks question** → AI gets PDF content as context
3. **AI responds** → Short, relevant answer referencing your PDF when helpful

## 💬 **Example Interactions:**

**User**: "I'm feeling anxious"
**AI**: "I understand that feeling. Try taking slow, deep breaths - inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4. This can help calm your nervous system. 🌿"

**User**: "How can I manage stress?"
**AI**: "Based on proven techniques, regular exercise and mindfulness can significantly reduce stress. Even 10 minutes of walking or meditation daily makes a difference. ✨"

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

### **PDF Loading:**
```dart
// Automatically loads on app start
await BackendPDFService.loadPDFFromAssets();

// Extracts text from your PDF
// Makes it available to AI for context
```

### **Response Control:**
- **Short responses**: AI instructed to keep answers brief
